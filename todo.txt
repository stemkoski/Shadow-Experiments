(1) Viewport example: divide screen into quadrants, 
    view objects from four different cameras,
    but OrbitControls only works from one camera (a perspective camera)

(1b) Add a single draggable cube that can be triggered from any of the viewports.
     (Might need 4 draggable objects, one for each camera.)



(2) Create a triangle of dragable circles with borders (images?), change color on hover,
    between each pair of circles is a line/rectangle(for thickness) whose position/orientation automatically updates.
